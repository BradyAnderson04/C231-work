My custom implementation of the DES algorithm loosely based off the code in external_resource

The supplementary file inspired how I organized sboxes and permutation tables. Alternatively I will 
also generate permutations using the built in permutations(bit string) using random to randomly
select one and store this permutation as the default permutation. Want to define a custom way to 
generate various permutation tables and sboxes for easy testing of various values to check different
strengths.
